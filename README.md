# Chemical-Equation-Balancer

Program that takes chemical equations and balances them. The user will input how many reactants and products they have in the equation. They will then enter the molecular formulas one by one using the following format: Water is H20. Aluminum Oxide is Al2O3. 

The formulas are read in under a formula class, which will then be used to manipulate the elements for storing and comparison. I will probably use dictionaries to store each formula and a dictionary for total elements on each side of the equation. I will also keep track of the coefficient here.
